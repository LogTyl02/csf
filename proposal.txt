This script will operate in two modes: vanilla, and Twitter. The vanilla mode will accept a text file, strip lines
and words from those lines, count syllables for each word, and attempt to create a pseudo-haiku from them.
There will be 3 haiku styles: 3/5/3 syllable count, 5/7/5 syllable count, and a free format which will have lines
of varying length, but will maintain a total syllable count of 17 or less. This format is based on the 'American Haiku'
format postulated by Jack Kerouac.


# PROPOSAL NOT FINISHED

# Twitter Haiku Generator

# Pull incoming public tweets from the Twitter stream / firehose
#   Either randomly, or with a set of data that determines appropriateness (hashtags, keywords, or what
#   have you, pull words and generate pseudohaiku with them.

# Pseudohaiku = Fits the mechanical form of haiku, correct syllable count per line, correct number of lines.
#   Does not necessarily fit the other requirements for haiku. (Nature word, cutting word, meaning)

# Ambitious goal, perhaps outside of the scope of this project currently: Fulfill the other requirements to
#   make more legitamite haiku. This might involve some machine learning stuff. This is for later.

# Also possible, but maybe for later: Feed the generated haiku into a website using web2py or Django. Allow
#   users to up or downvote haiku. Keep track of most popular haiku. This data can later be used for data
#   mining, trend tracking, or machine learning.

# Very ambitious, totally for later. Use vote data to teach the program to generate better haiku.



# Syllable count could be given to the program through a database. This might require restricting the scope
#   of words the program will find and use.
# Could write an algorithm to determine syllable length of a word, and provide a percentage of confidence
#   the length is correct. Ambiguous syllable counts will be discarded, or left later for manual
#   diambigutation or machine learning stuff.

# ( WEBSITE STUFF. TOTALLY FOR LATER. PROBABLY OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT FOR TIME LIMITATIONS )
# Data mining / trend stuff: Track popularity of haiku, certain words, word combinations, nature words, etc.
#   Maybe have a 'share' to Twitter button. Track shared haiku. If possible track the haiku itself ON twitter
#   and watch retweet trends.

# Track users for excessive voting behavior. Implement restrictions, banlists, etc.
# PHP backend, might have Royce do that for me. Can use my own website. Hosted on Royce's lineode.

# If the website goes up, a small terms of use might be in order. Have to check Twitter's terms to see
#   what, if any, intellectual property stuff is involved with me using words from random users. 
#   It's probably safe as long as I don't use phrases.

# The poems will be open for inspiration / maybe modification, but there will a request / plea to artistic
#   integrity to not claim the poems as your own. (This may be wishful thinking that the program could
#   generate anything someone might want to steal.

# OPEN SOURCE! COMMUNITY DRIVEN! MINDFULNESS FOR THE DIGITAL ERA! FREE DATA AND POETRY FOR EVERYBODY!
