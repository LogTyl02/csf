Reflection:

I didn't finish this assignment. I worked on it over the weekend for far more than 6 hours total, and it's beyond frustrating. I'm sure that learning
how to nest dictionaries and lists like this is valuable for doing really complex code down the line. (Or maybe it's not.) But I feel that if we were doing this
assignment with classes/objects, it might be easier. I could be completely wrong, and I'm not really interested in trying to implement that to test it.
I've been sick all weekend and trying to do problem solving is going nowhere.

I went through some of my peers' github accounts for clues or hints on how to approach the problems, but it looks like most people didn't even get as far as I did,
which while on one hand makes me feel a little bit better about having not finished the assignment, I also find it frustrating, because a lot of the time, when I can't
figure out a way to solve a problem, seeing someone else's solution can help me build an understanding of what about my approach was correct, and what was wrong, and
even some clever ways of tackling something.

I have a hunch that if I implemented earlier functions in the assignment differently, it might have helped with some of the later functions. But again, having not
designed the assignment, and not knowing exactly what each function was going to need as an input, my solutions are probably cludgy and lame.

At least programming is fun for me, and I'll be able to enjoy doing it in my spare time throughout my life. But increasingly I've become skeptical about my innate
abilities (lack thereof (especially with math)), and whether or not I'm cut out to find a career that involves this. That's OK though, because it can be a Way of Life
without being a job.
